# SysModels

This is a Julia package for creating Systems Models.

The code was written for modelling aspects of organizational security, and the
package currently reflects this.  Eventually, the goal is to move the
security-specific code into its own SecModels package, leaving the generic systems
modelling code here.

The code was written as part of the [Productive Security](http://www.riscs.org.uk/?page_id=15) project, and was used
in several publications:
